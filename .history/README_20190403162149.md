# IAMSAP/CMS

The goal of this project is to create a UI for a CMS that can have a backend in any language (as long as it's fast!). 

## Core Concepts

### Entities
Entities are the building blocks of the CMS. Entities can be anything: a blog post, an order, a product, whatever. This CMS knows how to manage Entities.
